/**
 * How a class's instances come in from a linked model (contract 1.7.0,
 * `kernel.ifc_import_rule` v1). The importer never decides what a product
 * becomes: it finds the class whose IFC home the product matches (the
 * reverse class map) and asks that class's rule. A class names its rule in
 * `ifc.import.rule`; without one it takes the rule registered for the kind it
 * recognises (`forKinds`). The kernel's rules read only geometry and the
 * class's own recognition fields, so any trade's class of those kinds comes
 * in with no kernel or importer edit, and an add-on registers rules for its
 * own kinds or classes the same way.
