/**
 * One tab pattern for every add-on's trade tab, so a person who learns one
 * can find the same kind of command in the same place on the next: Select,
 * then what you draw or place, how it is connected (links, systems), what the
 * model works out for it (checks, sizing), the trade's design records
 * (types), and the documents drawn from it (schedules, diagrams). A tab
 * leaves out the sections it has nothing for; the order never changes.
 *
 * The section words a person reads are fixed (round 15), the same on every
 * trade's tab: Create · Connect · Analyze · Design · Documents, after Select.
 * `tradeTab` writes them; a trade's own group label only shows after the word
 * when a section has more than one group ("Create · Datums", "Create · Build").
