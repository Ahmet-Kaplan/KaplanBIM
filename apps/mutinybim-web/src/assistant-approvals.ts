/**
 * Asking the person before an outside assistant changes a model.
 *
 * In order, the first way that works:
 * 1. The assistant's own approval box (MCP elicitation, form mode), when
 *    the assistant has one. The person answers there.
 * 2. An approval page in this app (/approvals/<id>). An assistant that can
 *    open links (MCP elicitation, URL mode) is asked to show it; the tool
 *    call waits a little under a minute for the answer, sending progress.
 * 3. If no one answered by then, the request stays on the approvals page
 *    for 30 minutes. An edit lands the moment the person approves it there;
 *    a script's output lands when the assistant sends it again.
 *
 * Requests are kept in the account database, so a restart of the server
 * loses none of them: an edit approved after a restart still lands, and a
 * retry approved before it still matches.
 *
 * Nothing here can be approved by the assistant: only the signed-in person
 * on the page, or the person in the assistant's own approval box.
